Guilt includes both thoughts of how we have failed and distressing emotions like sadness, anger, or anxiety. It can even cause physical reactions, such as an upset stomach. Some guilt can be healthy if you resolve it appropriately.
  
## Shame    
Shame is an intense feeling about the self that comes from failing to live up to your own or others' standards. The main difference is that with shame, you see yourself as a bad person rather than a good person who has done something bad. Shame is unhealthy, especially if it continues without being resolved. It only leads to further loss of self-esteem if you don't resolve it as quickly as possible.
